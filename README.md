# 📱 WhatsApp Chat UI Clone – HTML & CSS Only

This project is a **WhatsApp chat interface clone** created as part of my web development journey at **SMIT (Saylani Mass IT Training)**.  
It is built using **only HTML and CSS** — without using **Flexbox** or **CSS Grid** — to strengthen my understanding of basic layout and styling techniques.
